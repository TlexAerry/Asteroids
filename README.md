# Asteroids

My version of the classic Asteroids game. Base game is complete. Next steps are:

    Add a scoring system
    Implement proper UI:
        - Ability to pause
        - Ability to close game
        - Indicator of number of lives
        - Indicator of score
    Implement respawning 
    Add an explosion effect for the asteroids (as part of the collision method for asteroid)
    Add acceleration to the player movement
    Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
    Add a background image
    Give asteroids health bars
    Create different weapon types
    Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
    Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
    Add a shield power-up
    Add a speed power-up
    Add bombs that can be dropped
